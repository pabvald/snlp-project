`What CAN all that green stuff be?'
said a whiting to a snail.
`The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance.
`You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in this way!
`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out, `You'd better not do that again!'
said the Gryphon.
said the Caterpillar.
How puzzling all these changes are!
she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.
`Who's making personal remarks now?'
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!'
`There's PLENTY of room!'
the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.
`Off with her head!'
CHAPTER VIII
If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were.
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
Oh my dear paws!
`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!'
Would the fall NEVER come to an end!
added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.
catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!
The next witness was the Duchess's cook.
My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it.
`But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.
`Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here?
`It's no business of MINE.'
said the Duck.
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
`Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'
it was too late to wish that!
After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A barrowful will do, to begin with.'
I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!
`What was THAT like?'
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, `--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.
You're a serpent; and there's no use denying it.
CHAPTER VI
`Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'
`Who cares for you?'
`It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much.
I needn't be afraid of them!'
`I've something important to say!'
it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.
`No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.
I said "What for?"'
As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT' engraved upon it.
Everybody looked at Alice.
`--I proceed.
the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.
Oh dear!
and sometimes, `Do bats eat cats?'
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
`But you're so easily offended, you know!'
The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.
wow!
`Oh, I beg your pardon!'
`But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.
`UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant-- unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word sounded best.
(He pronounced it `arrum.')
`Well!
said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.
`Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'
`Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'
`Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'
said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.
`Come, let's try the first figure!'
I wonder what I should be like then?'
said Alice.
Alas!
However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!
`No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.
she answered herself.
The first witness was the Hatter.
`Call it what you like,' said the Cat.
said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.
said the Hatter.
There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'
`Stuff and nonsense!'
said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
Why, it fills the whole window!'
said the Caterpillar contemptuously.
Who would not give all else for two Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
`"Will you walk a little faster?"
"I'll be judge, I'll be jury," Said cunning old Fury: "I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death."'
Presently she began again.
the Hatter asked triumphantly.
`It is a very good height indeed!'
`You insult me by talking such nonsense!'
`Nonsense!'
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer- shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.
`I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth!
`I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
`What did they live on?'
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.
`Do as I tell you, you coward!'
However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out `The race is over!'
Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?'
said the Duchess.
asked another of the jurymen.
cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
`What are they doing?'
Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
I'm mad.
`And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know--'
`That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.
`It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'
said the Mock Turtle.
`Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.'
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.
said the Cat in a low voice.
`I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'
`Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!
`Oh, you foolish Alice!'
`She'd soon fetch it back!'
`What size do you want to be?'
So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!
`Not like cats!'
The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
`If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the matter worse.
`How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?'
The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
`Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!'
`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
`Two lines!'
`I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.
The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
said Alice to herself.
Where are you?'
`Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the words have got altered.'
I wish you were down here with me!
`Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
`'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
`Yes, please do!'
`I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!'
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!
She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
It's HIM.'
Alice asked.
For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'
`If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'
The Mock Turtle's Story
This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--
YOU do it!--That I won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill!
It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'
`Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are painting those roses?'
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
`With extras?'
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there.
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
`It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.
The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.
`I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'
Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!'
`Found WHAT?'
`YOU'D better not talk!'
`It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.
`They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: `Dear, dear!
I'm sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it.
`I never thought about it,' said Alice.
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
`I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.
So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?'
`How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going messages for a rabbit!
And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: `but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.'
`You might just as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!'
So they got thrown out to sea.
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!'
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
he asked.
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides, what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'
`Just think of what work it would make with the day and night!
`Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?'
said Alice.
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.
`I wish I hadn't cried so much!'
`You make me giddy.'
Alice asked.
* * * * * * *
ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
`And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they are the jurors.'
screamed the Gryphon.
When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'
`What is his sorrow?'
So they got their tails fast in their mouths.
The Queen!'
Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'
`Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!'
She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?'
`Oh, do let me help to undo it!'
said the March Hare.
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.
`No, no!
`It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said the March Hare.
`Read them,' said the King.
`How can you learn lessons in here?
So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!
`What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, `was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'
He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice.
And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours."'
Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please, sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
screamed the Pigeon.
He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
I think that will be the best plan.'
She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself `That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!'
`I make you a present of everything I've said as yet.'
Pig!'
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled.
said the Eaglet.
`It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.
`Not yet, not yet!'
`The idea of having the sentence first!'
Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.
CHAPTER VII
`Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'
when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.
`I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.
Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh!
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.
CHAPTER X
She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
I must have been changed for Mabel!
asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.
interrupted Alice.
`If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.
No, no!
`Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
`THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
`Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'
She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
But she did not venture to say it out loud.
But I'd better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'
Come on!'
`Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What are tarts made of?'
There was exactly one a-piece all round.
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
`They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'
The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, `"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.
`Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody minding their own business!'
`Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.
The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.
`You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
`Certainly not!'
`Speak English!'
And he added in an undertone to the Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.
Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered.
`I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.
said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her.
The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: `No room!
CHAPTER V
`Why not?'
`Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'
shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.
"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
`I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!
Oh, my dear Dinah!
thought Alice to herself.
In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
`Hold your tongue!'
`What do you mean by that?'
said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the creatures argue.
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.'
`I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but those serpents!
`Who are YOU?'
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.
`What day of the month is it?'
said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.
`As if I would talk on such a subject!
First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
`But who is to give the prizes?'
she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know.
Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table.
`Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?
Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.
He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.
`You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'
Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!
`Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?'
and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air.
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes.
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
shouted Alice.
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
The Queen smiled and passed on.
`You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep you've had!'
Alice replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present-- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.'
There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!'
Pig and Pepper
Where did they draw the treacle from?'
Dinah my dear!
Good-bye, feet!'
he went on, turning to Alice.
`What fun!'
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).
sighed the Hatter.
`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet!
`He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.
said Alice.
He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.
`IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.'
said the Queen, turning purple.
`Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.
`Come on!'
`Then the Dormouse shall!'
And the executioner went off like an arrow.
Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?
(Sounds of more broken glass.)
`Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, `when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time!
